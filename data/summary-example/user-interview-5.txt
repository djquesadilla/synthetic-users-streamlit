**Description of problems:**

Hello, my name is Olivia Johnson. I am a 55-year-old luxury property developer based in London, UK. One of the problems I am facing is that everything seems to be boring. As someone who is open to new experiences and constantly seeks excitement, I find it frustrating when I encounter things that fail to captivate or challenge me. This impacts me both personally and professionally. Personally, it leaves me feeling unfulfilled and dissatisfied with my daily life. Professionally, it hampers my creativity and ability to innovate in my work as a luxury property developer. I am constantly looking for new ideas and inspiration, but when everything feels dull, it becomes a significant barrier to my success.

**Strategies used to resolve problems:**

To try to resolve the problem of everything feeling boring, I have employed a few strategies. Firstly, I actively seek out new experiences and opportunities. I attend various events, exhibitions, and conferences related to my industry and beyond. I also engage in hobbies and activities that are different from my usual routine, such as trying out new sports or exploring different forms of art.

Secondly, I make an effort to surround myself with diverse and interesting people. I attend networking events and socialize with individuals from different backgrounds and industries. This helps me gain new perspectives and keeps me engaged in stimulating conversations.

Lastly, I constantly challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone. Whether it's taking on new projects or learning new skills, I push myself to explore unfamiliar territories. This not only helps me combat the feeling of boredom but also allows me to grow personally and professionally.

While these strategies have been somewhat effective in keeping me engaged and motivated, I still encounter challenges in my quest for excitement and novelty.

**Challenges with current approach:**

Yes, there are indeed challenges with my current approach. One of the main obstacles I face is finding truly unique and stimulating experiences. Despite actively seeking out new opportunities, it can be difficult to come across experiences that genuinely captivate my interest and provide the level of excitement I desire. Many events and activities tend to be repetitive or lack the innovation and creativity I am looking for.

Additionally, the time and effort required to constantly search for new experiences can be demanding. As a busy professional, it can be challenging to dedicate sufficient time to explore and discover novel opportunities. This can sometimes lead to a feeling of frustration and a sense of stagnation.

Furthermore, the cost associated with seeking out new experiences can also be a barrier. Attending high-end events or engaging in unique activities often comes with a significant price tag. As a luxury property developer, I have the financial means to afford certain experiences, but it can still be limiting and not accessible to everyone.

These challenges have made it difficult to consistently find a solution that fully addresses my problem of everything feeling boring.

**Additional challenges:**

Yes, there are a few other challenges related to my problem of everything feeling boring. One of them is the societal expectation and pressure to conform to certain standards of luxury and sophistication. As a luxury property developer, there is an inherent expectation for me to engage in activities and experiences that are perceived as "high-class" or "exclusive". This can sometimes limit my ability to explore unconventional or offbeat experiences that may be more exciting to me personally, but may not align with societal expectations.

Another challenge is the potential lack of understanding and support from others who may not share the same desire for excitement and novelty. People with different personalities or interests may not fully comprehend the impact that the feeling of boredom has on my life and may not be able to provide the necessary support or suggestions for addressing the issue.

Lastly, there is the risk of becoming too reliant on external sources for excitement and not cultivating internal sources of fulfillment and creativity. While seeking out new experiences is important, it is also essential to develop a sense of curiosity and contentment within oneself. Balancing external stimulation with internal growth can be a challenge in addressing the problem of everything feeling boring.

**Effectiveness of proposed solution:**

The proposed solution of a submarine to go see the Titanic is an interesting concept that could potentially address the problem of everything feeling boring. It offers a unique and exhilarating experience that is not commonly available to the general public. Exploring the depths of the ocean and witnessing the historic wreckage of the Titanic could certainly provide a sense of adventure and excitement.

However, it is important to consider the limitations and feasibility of this solution. While the idea itself is appealing, there are several factors that may impact its effectiveness. Firstly, the accessibility and availability of such a submarine experience could be a challenge.
